      	<p> 
					I'm currently working as a Labor Market and Performance Data Analyst with Mecklenburg County’s workforce development board, Charlotte Works. In this role, 
					I perform labor market research and analysis for internal staff, local economic developers, and employers. I maintain a monthly dashboard that tracks various 
					grant program performance metrics and KPIs. I assist in the creation and maintenance of multiple public-facing labor market information projects, blogs, and 
					social media content.
					<br>
					<br>
					I received an associate degree from Central Piedmont Community College. I'm currently studying Data Science at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte. 
					I volunteered in the CMS district for 4 years as a tutor and mentor to homeless children. I've previously enjoyed over ten years building relationships in 
					customer-facing positions, six years developing leadership skills in the United States Marine Corps Reserves where I was Honorably Discharged as a Sergeant, 
					and five years in sales positions with focuses on real estate, banking, telecom, and residential security.
					<br>
					<br>
					When I’m not working you can find me spending time with my beautiful family or relaxing with a book. I'm constantly looking for new learning opportunities and 
					ways to grow. I hope to leave my mark by inspiring others to make the world a better place.
