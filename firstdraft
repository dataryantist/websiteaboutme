        I'm currently working as a Labor Market and Performance Data Analyst with Mecklenburg County’s workforce development board, Charlotte Works. In this role, 
        I perform labor market research and analysis for internal staff, local economic developers, and employers. I maintain a monthly dashboard that tracks various 
        grant program performance metrics and KPIs. I assist in the creation and maintenance of multiple public-facing labor market information projects, blogs, and 
        social media content.

        I received an associate degree from Central Piedmont Community College. I'm currently studying Data Science at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte. 
        I volunteered in the CMS district for 4 years as a tutor and mentor to homeless children. I've previously enjoyed over ten years building relationships in 
        customer-facing positions, six years developing leadership skills in the United States Marine Corps Reserves where I was Honorably Discharged as a Sergeant, 
        and five years in sales positions with focuses on real estate, banking, telecom, and residential security.

        When I’m not working you can find me spending time with my beautiful family or relaxing with a book. I'm constantly looking for new learning opportunities and 
        ways to grow. I hope to leave my mark by inspiring others to make the world a better place.
